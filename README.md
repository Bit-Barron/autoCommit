This is a Github bot that automatically commits every day for you.

1.You need to change the gitUrl to the repository you want to push every day.
You can just fork this repo and publish it to GitHub, then you don't need to change anything.

1.The time variable can be changed to any time you want.
1.It just says "commit for me" at 12:00.

Good luck! Don't forget to follow me!
